A group of six to eight arteries arises separately \nfrom the inferior phrenic arteries.\n• The middle adrenal artery arises from the aorta just proximal to the origin of the \nrenal artery. It can be single, multiple, or absent. It supplies the perirenal fat only.\n• One or more inferior adrenal arteries arise from the renal artery, an accessory \nrenal artery, or a superior polar artery.

The projected area where the kid -\nneys lay has four sides, and its boundaries are the 12th rib, the iliac crest, the verte -\nbral column, and a longitudinal line starting at the ipsilateral anterior superior iliac \nline. The right kidney is usually lower than the left kidney because of the right \nhepatic lobe.\nThe muscles of the back around the kidney can be divided into three layers \n(Fig./uni00A0 25.1):\n (a) Super/f_icial: latissimus dorsi and external oblique muscle\n (b) Middle: posteroinferior serratus, sacrospinalis, and internal oblique muscle\n (c) Deep: quadratus lumborum muscle, psoas major, and transverse abdomi -\nnis muscle\nThe right kidney is related anteriorly to the liver superiorly, to the duodenum \n(close to the renal hilum) and the ascending colon inferiorl"
